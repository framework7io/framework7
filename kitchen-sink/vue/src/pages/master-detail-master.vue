        Master-Detail pattern oftenly used on wide enough screens and tablets, and consists of two
        views. Master - is an area in the UI where you have a list of something. Detail - is the
        area that shows the relevant information of a selection in the master.
      </p>
      <p>To see Master Detail view make sure the window width is larger than 800px.</p>
      <p>
        When collapsed (on narrow screen) navigation between such pages will behave as usual
        routing.
      </p>
      <p>Navigation to/from Master-Detail view happens without transition.</p>
