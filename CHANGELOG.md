## CSS & Theming

- iOS Dark theme colors reworked to match iOS 13 dark theme colors
- Most of CSS variables related to colors (especially "gray" colors) reworked to `rgba` colors to appear better on custom designs. It is related to text colors, background colors, icons colors, borders and hairlines colors.
- Most of iOS theme `15px` sizes (list/blocks paddings and margins) are changed to `16px` instead
- New CSS breakpoints. Now there are new names for app sizes instead of `tablet-` and `desktop-` before. Now they are:
  - `xsmall` - width more than `480px`
  - `small` - width more than `568px`
  - `medium` - width more than `768px`
  - `large` - width more than `1024px`
  - `xlarge` - width more than `1200px`
- Dark Theme can now be excluded from bundle (custom build)
- Light Theme can now also be excluded from bundle (custom build)

## Core Package

- Now core package contains new `framework7-lite.js`, `framework7-lite.bundle.js` scripts. Difference with usual scripts is that these "lite" versions don't contain Component (Router Component) functionality. This version is recommended to use with F7-Vue/React versions where you anyway use Vue/React components instead.

## Core APIs & Modules

- **iOS Translucent**
  - New `iosTranslucentBars` app parameter to enable translucent effect (blur background) on navigation bars (by default enabled)
  - New `iosTranslucentModals` app parameter to enable translucent effect (blur background) on modals (Dialog, Popover, Actions) (by default enabled)
- **Connection API** (new)

  - Request "promise" methods now will be rejected with `{ message, status, xhr }` object (rather than with just `status` like before)
- **Statusbar**
  - Statusbar overlay element (`<div class="statusbar">`) and related functionality has been removed in favor of using that space by navigation bars and other elements to provide true full-screen experience and customization. Statusbar cordova's API is there as it was before.

  - Fast clicks functionality has been completely removed. Following `app.touch`' parameters are not supported anymore: `fastClicks`, `fastClicksDistanceThreshold`, `fastClicksDelayBetweenClicks` and `fastClicksExclude`
  - Added support to disable "active state" on specific elements by adding `no-active-state` class to such elements
- **View/Router**
  - New `loadInitialPage` (boolean) parameter. When enabled, and there is no children pages inside of the View. It will load initial page that matches to initial URL (default true)

  - Custom transition can now also be specified via `data-transition` attribute on links
  - Route declaration now supports new `viewName` property. And whatever View such route requested, it will be loaded in View specified in `viewName` property.
  - Route declaration now supports new `options.transition` string property to specify custom transition for this route
  - Route declaration now supports new `asyncComponent` method that should return Promise resolved with Component or ES module with `.default` property containing Component
  - It is now possible to specify "current" view for link to load the page with `data-view="current"` attribute
  - `iosSeparateDynamicNavbar` parameter has been removed and behavior that uses with `iosSeparateDynamicNavbar: false` is not supported anymore

  - Now calendar value will be cleared on related input's clear (when "clear button" clicked)
  - Calendar has been reworked to use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` API.
    - New `locale` parameter (e.g. `en-US`). If not specified, it will use browser locale
    - `dateFormat` now can accept `Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions` (e.g. `{ month: 'long', day: 'numeric' }`)

  - Removed declaration for list icon default color (that could make it harder to customize)
- **Login Screen**
  - Now it centers content vertically
- **Navbar**
  - iOS theme dynamic Navbar behavior totally reworked. Now it doesn't take `navbar-inner` from the page's Navbar, but takes whole Navbar element. It makes it easier to customize each navbar (bg color, text color, hairlines, shadows) and brings better transitions between them.
  - Navbar size now will be increased (when top safe-area is in place) to cover the status bar space. This gives even better full-screen experience and transitions.
  - Navbar HTML layout has been reworked, now it has new `navbar-bg` element:
    ```html
    <div class="navbar">
      <div class="navbar-bg"></div>
      <div class="navbar-inner">...</div>
    </div>
    ```
  - Large Navbar should now have addition `navbar-large` class on navbar itself (instead of `navbar-large-inner` on `navbar-inner`):

      <div class="navbar-bg"></div>
      <div class="navbar-inner">...</div>
    </div>
    ```

* **Panel**
  - Panels functionality has been fully reworked and now behaves more like a modals, which means we now can have as many panels as we want (or need) not limited to only 2 (left and right) panels.
  - The following parameter has been removed from `app.panel` parameters: `leftBreakpoint`, `rightBreakpoint`, `swipe`, `swipeActiveArea`, `swipeCloseActiveAreaSide`, `swipeOnlyClose`, `swipeThreshold`, `closeByBackdropClick`.
  - Now every panel must be initialized separately and panel parameters must be specified for each panel.
  - It is now possible to auto init the panel by adding `panel-init` class and specify such panel parameters with `data-` attributes, e.g.:
    ```html
    <div class="panel panel-left panel-cover" data-swipe="true" data-visible-breakpoint="1200">
      ...
    </div>
    ```
  - Each panel supports new set of parameters:
    - `backdrop` - enables backdrop
    - `backdropEl` - specify custom backdrop element
    - `collapsedBreakpoint` (number) - app width when panel becomes partially visible (collapsed)
    - `visibleBreakpoint` (number) - app width when panel becomes fully visible
    - `swipe` (boolean) - makes panel swipeable
    - `swipeOnlyClose` (boolean) - makes panel swipeable but only to close
    - `swipeActiveArea` (number) - active area from the edge of the screen where panel swipes enabled
    - `swipeThreshold` (number) - panel will not move with swipe if "touch distance" will be less than this value
  - Each panel instance has new methods:
    - `enableVisibleBreakpoint()`
    - `disableVisibleBreakpoint()`
    - `toggleVisibleBreakpoint()`
    - `enableCollapsedBreakpoint()`
    - `disableCollapsedBreakpoint()`
    - `toggleCollapsedBreakpoint()`
    - `enableResizable()`
    - `disableResizable()`
    - `enableSwipe()`
    - `disableSwipe()`
  - `app.panel.open(panel)/close(panel)` methods now can receive panel element (or CSS selector) of the panel to open/close. `left` and `right` values are still work but on only if you have only one left or right panel
  - The following F7 instance props and methods removed and intended to be used on panel instance instead:
    - `app.panel.enableSwipe()`
    - `app.panel.disableSwipe()`
    - `app.panel.enableResizableSwipe()`
    - `app.panel.disableResizableSwipe()`
    - `app.panel.left`

  - New boolean `push` parameter. When enabled it will push view behind on open. Works only when top safe area is in place. It can also enabled by adding `sheet-push` class to sheet modal element.
  - Swipeable Sheet Modal now correctly handles scrolling inside of nested `page-content` element
* **Sortable**
  - Sortable `sort` event data now also contain `el` property with reference to sorted item
  - Now sorting can be done on tap-hold. It can be enabled by adding additional `sortable-tap-hold` to `sortable` container. Also `app.touch.tapHold` should be enabled to emit `taphold` events.

    - Fully removed Internet Explorer support
    - `breakpointsInverse` parameter has been removed and now `breakpoints` behave like with `breakpointsInverse: true` before.
    - `touchMoveStopPropagation` parameter now defaults to `false`
    - `click` event won't be fired with 300ms delay anymore. Now it will be fired at the same time as `tap` event
    - When `slidesPerColumnFill: 'column'` it now uses `flex-direction: column` layout which requires specified height on swiper-container
    - `slidesPerColumn` now can be used with breakpoints
    - Now Swiper styles use CSS Custom Properties (CSS Custom Variables) to specify swiper's color theme (color of navigation buttons/pagination). It is now `--swiper-theme-color: #007aff;`
    - Improved `es` module "tree-shake-ability"
    - New `swiper.esm.browser.bundle.js` package that can be used directly in browser (`import Swiper from 'swiper.esm.browser.bundle.js'`)

* **Timeline**
  - Now it uses new breakpoint names for `{size}-sides` classes (e.g. `tablet-sides` -> `medium-sides`, etc.)
* **Toolbar**
  - Tabbar labels text (font) size increased in iOS theme

## Framework7 Router Component

- Now it supports async `data` method (where it must return Promise)
  ```js
  export default {
    async data() {
      const user = await fetch('some/path').then((res) => res.json());
      return {
        user,
      };
    },
  };
  ```
  or
  ```js
  export default {
    data() {
      return new Promise((resolve) => {
        fetch('some/path')
          .then((res) => res.json())
          .then((user) => resolve({ user }));
      });
    },
  };
  ```
- Component DOM updates are now async. It means that it is not guaranteed that DOM will be updated right after calling `$setState`. So there is a new `$tick` context method that can be safely used to reference DOM and ensure it was updated:
  ```js
  this.$setState({ foo: 'bar' });
  this.$setState({ john: 'doe' });
  this.$tick(() => {
    // DOM updated
  });
  ```
- `$setState` now also receives second callback argument that will be fired on DOM update:
  ```js
  this.$setState({ foo: 'bar' }, () => {
    // DOM updated
  });
  ```
- Component context has new `$update(callback)` method that can be used instead of `$setState` to just trigger DOM update:
  ```js
  this.foo = 'bar';
  this.$update(() => {
    // DOM updated
  });
  ```
- Added support for mixins that can be re-used in components. Mixin can extend any component lifecycle hook, methods and `data`. Mixins should be passed in component's `mixins` property as an array:
  ```js
  const mountedMixin = {
    mounted() {
      // do something on mounted
      console.log('mounted');
    },
  };
  const defaultDataMixin = {
    data() {
      return { foo: 'bar' };
    },
  };
  // extend component with mixins
  export default {
    mixins: [mountedMixin, defaultDataMixin],
    data() {
      return { john: 'doe' };
    },
    // ...
  };
  ```
- It is also possible to register global mixins with new method `Framework7.registerComponentMixin(mixinName, mixin)`
  ```js
  Framework7.registerComponentMixin('default-data-mixin', {
    data() {
      return { foo: 'bar' };
    },
  });
  ```
  And use it like:
  ```js
  export default {
    mixins: ['default-data-mixin'],
    data() {
      return { john: 'doe' };
    },
    // ...
  };
  ```
- Now it is possible to create custom reusable components with new method `Framework7.registerComponent(tagName, component)`
  ```js
  Framework7.registerComponent('my-list-item', {
    data() {
      return { foo: 'bar' };
    },
    template: `
      <li class="list-item" id="{{foo}}">...</li>
    `,
  });
  ```
  And use it in other components like:
  ```html
  <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <my-list-item></my-list-item>
    </ul>
  </div>
  ```
- New `class` based syntax for components for better TypeScript support:

  ```js
  import { Component } from 'famework7';

  export default class extends Component {
    data() {
      return { foo: 'bar' };
    }
    mounted() {
      console.log('mounted');
      this.onMounted(); // call method
    }
    onMounted() {
      // ...
    }
    // ...
  }
  ```

## Phenome (Vue/React)

- Now it is possible to get Framework7 instance, `f7ready` function and `theme` by directly importing them from package. This can be useful for functional components that don't have F7 extensions, e.g.:

  ```js
  import { f7, f7ready, theme } from 'framework7-react';

  // or

  import { f7, f7ready, theme } from 'framework7-vue';
  ```

- Most of internal events reworked to use custom events system instead of DOM events. So all component events don't contain reference to HTML elements anymore.

## Phenome (Vue/React) Components

- **Block**
  - `tabletInset` prop has been removed
  - New inset props to reflect new breakpoint names: `xsmallInset`, `smallInset`, `mediumInset`, `largeInset`, `xlargeInset`
- **Button**
  - New `transition` (string) prop to specify custom page transition name for list link
- **Grid**
  - `Col` component now uses new breakpoint names for responsive size props. So there are new props instead of `tabletWidth` and `desktopWidth`: `xsmall`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge`.
    ```html
      <Col size="50" medium="33" large="25">...</Col>
    ```
- **Icon**
  - `size` prop will also set element `width` and `height` in addition to just `font-size` (like before)

  - New `sortableTapHold` prop to enable sorting on tap hold. Also `app.touch.tapHold` parameter should be enable to emit `taphold` events.
  - `tabletInset` prop has been removed
  - New inset props to reflect new breakpoint names: `xsmallInset`, `smallInset`, `mediumInset`, `largeInset`, `xlargeInset`
- **ListItem**
  - `accordionBeforeOpen`, `accordionBeforeClose` events now contain `prevent` method as first argument
  - `swipeout` event now contains swipeout `progress` as first argument

- Utils' `.promise` now returns native Promise if it is supported by browser and fallback to Promise-like polyfill if it is not supported.
